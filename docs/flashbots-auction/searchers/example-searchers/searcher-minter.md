title: Searcher Minter

searcher-minter is a repository that contains a very simple demo application which allows arbitrary submission of a single transaction to Flashbots. This could be used for many simple purposes, but in the demonstration, the goal was to mint an NFT.

You can find a walkthrough of Flashbots and the creation of this NFT minting bot here: [Using Flashbots to Mint NFTs on Ethereum - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ve1YIpDs_I)
