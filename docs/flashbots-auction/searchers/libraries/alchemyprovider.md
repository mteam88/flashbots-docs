title: Alchemy Provider
---
The Alchemy SDK makes getting started, shipping builds, and accessing support faster and more streamlined. For instance, it provides high-level access to the `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` and `eth_cancelPrivateTransaction` RPC endpoints.

Benefits of the Alchemy SDK include providing:

**1. Automatic management of your Flashbots reputation** - the SDK takes on the work of actively, and manually, managing your reputation. Learn more about reputation [here](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/reputation#querying-reputation)

**2. A superset of the ethers.js Provider library plus the suite of Alchemy APIs** - the Alchemy Provider exposes all Flashbots JSON-RPC endpoints. The Flashbots API can be used natively with the core EVM APIs as well as the suite of Alchemy APIs

**3. Webhook based notifications on [included and dropped private transactions](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-notify#features)**
