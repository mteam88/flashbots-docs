title: MEV-Blocks API
---
mev-blocks is a a public API for displaying flashbots blocks and transactions.

Access it here: [blocks.flashbots.net](https://blocks.flashbots.net/)

## New Blocks API fields

For the PoS Ethereum merge, we added new fields to the Blocks API response to align the API with PoS Ethereum nomenclature.

Old fields were left in place for backwards compatibility with clients, and have been retrofitted to populate with data from the Flashbots builder.

| Parent Type | Old Name | New Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _`blocks`_ | `miner` | `fee_recipient` |
| _`blocks`_ | `miner_reward` | `fee_recipient_eth_diff` |
| _`blocks`_ | `coinbase_transfers` | `eth_sent_to_fee_recipient` |
| _`transactions`_ | `total_miner_reward` | `fee_recipient_eth_diff` |
| _`transactions`_ | `coinbase_transfer` | `eth_sent_to_fee_recipient` |

:::note

Old names will be removed in a future release.
